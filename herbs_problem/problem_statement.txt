% ---
%
% The problem describes a search tree of depth 100 and constant branching factor 5.
%
% - There is a cupboard with 10 x 10 drawers, traversed by row first, column second,
%   defining 100 places.
%   Each drawer is given a coordinate from (1,1) to (10,10) in the course material.
%   We use (0,0) to (9,9) instead.
%
% - In each drawer, there a 5 types of seeds associated with 5 different elements,
%   metal, woof, water, fire, earth.
%
% - Shennong Shi goes through the drawers by row first, column second.
%
% - He selects a seed from the 5 in each each drawer while upholding certain constraints
%   among the seeds already selected and the new seed.
%
% - Once he has traversed all 100 drawers and upheld all constraints, he has a valid
%   seed sequence.
%
% Constraints are as follows:
%
% - The elements of the seeds selected from adjacent drawers (a drawer and its successor
%   drawer) *in the same row* must obey either a "generative" or a "destructive"
%   relationships (freely selected), as follows:
%
%   generative             destructive
%   ----------             -----------
%   water -> wood          water -> fire
%   wood  -> fire          fire -> metal
%   fire  -> earth         metal -> wood
%   earth -> metal         wood -> earth
%   metal -> water         earth -> water
%
% - The seed from the first drawer cannot be associated with "metal".
%
% - In each column, between 1 and 2 seeds must be associated with "metal".
%
% - In each column, between 1 and 2 seeds must be associated with "earth".

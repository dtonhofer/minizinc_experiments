# minizinc_experiments

Some code created while experimenting with MiniZinc during the course [Solving Algorithms for Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/solving-algorithms-discrete-optimization) by Prof. Jimmy Ho Man Lee and Prof. Peter James Stuckey.

The code for that course is at https://github.com/MiniZinc/specialization-examples

- [A Perl script](https://github.com/dtonhofer/minizinc_experiments/tree/main/stats_collection) to collect statistics created by running the same MiniZinc program with varying "search strategy" annotations
- [Notes on compiling MiniZinc](https://github.com/dtonhofer/minizinc_experiments/tree/main/compiling_minizinc)
   - To be comleted for coompiling gecode and chuffed. 
   - Note that you want to actually compile the development versions as these have bugfixes
